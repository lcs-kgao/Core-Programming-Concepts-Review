 # Question 2
 
 Imagine you're creating the ultimate competitor to GitHub.
 
 You want to keep track of the following metrics for each repository:
 
 - Number of commits: the total number of commits to the repository
 - Number of forks: the number of forks people have made from the repository
 - Year created: The year the repository was created
 - Month created: The month the repository was created represented by a number between 1 and 12
 - Day created: The day of the month the repository was created

 For each piece of information above, create a variable or constant (whatever is more appropriate).
 
 Then, use `print()` statements to briefly explain why you chose to use a variable or a constant for each piece of information above.

// Answer question 2 below
var numberOfCommits : Int
print("The number of commits will always change, so a variable data type should be used in here.")
var numberOfForks : Int
print("The number of forks will change, so we should use variable")
let yearCreated : Int
print("The year was created will never change, so use a constant.")
let monthCreated : Int
print("The month was created will never change, so use a constant.")
let dayCreated : Int
print("The day was created will never change, so use a constant.")
